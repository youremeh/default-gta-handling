# GTAV Handling
This is a resource for all the default GTAV vehicle handling files. Nothing was changed, all I did was extract them into their own meta file (using Meta Splitter) and upload them.

## What's the difference?
The following vehicles are the only ones to have a difference between the legacy handling, and the enhanced handling:
